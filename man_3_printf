PRINTF(3)                  Library Functions Manual                 PRINTF(3)

NAME
       _printf - print text and variables in a formatted way

SYNOPSIS
       #include "main.h"

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The _printf() function is a simplified version of the C library printf.
       It sends output to the standard output (your screen).

       The format string can contain:
        - Normal characters: they are printed exactly as they are.
        - Special format codes starting with %: these are replaced with values
          from the extra arguments that follow.

       Supported format codes in this project are:
              %c   Print a single character.
              %s   Print a string (prints "(null)" if the string is NULL).
              %%   Print a literal percent sign.
              %d   Print a signed decimal integer.
              %i   Print a signed decimal integer (same as %d).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, _printf() returns the number of characters printed.
       On error, it returns -1.

EXAMPLES
       _printf("Hello %s\n", "Rateel");
              Output: Hello Rateel

       _printf("Value: %d\n", 2025);
              Output: Value: 2025
